# Recommended improvements:
# 1. Replace the loop with the sum() function for a more efficient calculation of the sum.
# 2. Remove the unnecessary code to create a vector of numbers, as it is not used in the calculation.

# Calculating the sum using sum() function
sum_result <- sum(numbers)

cat("The sum of numbers is:", sum_result, "\n")
